# Security Policy

## Principles
- Defense in depth
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular security audits
- Continuous monitoring

## Authentication
- Two-factor authentication
- Strong password policies
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Secure password reset mechanism

## Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Granular permission management
- Module-level security isolation
- Middleware-based access checks

## Roles and Permissions

### Permission Management System
- Implemented using Spatie Laravel-permission package
- Supports granular, module-specific access control
- Centralized permission registration and management

### Security Principles
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Users granted minimum necessary permissions
   - Explicit permission requirements
   - Granular access control

2. **Dynamic Permission Registration**
   - Modules can define custom roles and permissions
   - Flexible, context-specific access management
   - Prevents hard-coded, inflexible permission structures

3. **Server-Side Validation**
   - All permission checks performed server-side
   - Client-side checks used only for UI optimization
   - Prevents client-side permission manipulation

### Permission Checking Mechanisms
- Controller authorization
- Route middleware protection
- Blade template directives
- Programmatic permission verification

### Best Practices
- Use specific, minimal permissions
- Regularly audit permission configurations
- Implement comprehensive permission testing
- Monitor and log permission changes

### Example Permission Structure
```php
$manager->registerModulePermissions('quotes', [
    'view' => 'View quotes',
    'create' => 'Create quotes',
    'edit' => 'Edit quotes'
]);

$manager->registerModuleRoles('quotes', [
    'administrator' => ['view', 'create', 'edit'],
    'creator' => ['view', 'create']
]);
```

### Security Recommendations
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Use strong password policies
- Enable account lockout mechanisms
- Regularly update and patch dependencies
- Conduct security audits
- Monitor and log authentication events

### Potential Vulnerabilities
- Overly broad permissions
- Lack of permission granularity
- Insufficient permission validation
- Hardcoded access control

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive permission testing
- Use automated security scanning
- Conduct regular permission audits
- Develop permission change tracking
- Create permission visualization tools

### Future Enhancements
- Machine learning-based permission recommendations
- Advanced permission analytics
- Zero-trust authentication models
- Blockchain-based identity management

## Audit and Logging
- Comprehensive login attempt logging
- Track user actions across modules
- Immutable audit trail
- Secure log storage and rotation

## Protection Mechanisms
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection prevention
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting

## Dependency Management
- Regular security updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- Dependency audit
- Minimal external package usage

## Recommended Security Practices
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement secure headers
- Regular penetration testing
- Keep all systems updated
- Use environment-based configuration

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please send details to security@portal.com.

### Responsible Disclosure
- Provide detailed information
- Allow reasonable time for resolution
- Do not publicly disclose before fix
